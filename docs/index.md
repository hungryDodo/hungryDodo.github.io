## About Me

To me, travel isn't just about scenery - it's about measuring cultural warmth step by step. Whether bargaining in morning markets with local dialects or stargazing during wilderness camping, these moments make life vibrant. My hands-on hobbies perfectly complement this curiosity: from modifying camping gear to designing travel journal bindings, I thrive on turning ideas into tangible creations. Currently learning woodworking, with a dream to craft foldable portable tea sets for my next adventure.
